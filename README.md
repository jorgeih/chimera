# Welcome to Chimera
Chimera is an engine for executing fragment based case models, an approach that allows for modelling flexible business processes. It was developed at the [Business Process Technology (BPT) group](http://bpt.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/Public/) at the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI). It is provided under the MIT free and open source software license (see LICENSE.md). Chimera supports:

* Execution and combination of [BPMN2](http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/) models based on data dependencies
* Integration to external events via the Complex Event Processing engine [Unicorn](https://bpt.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/UNICORN)
* Usage of external APIs via webservice tasks.

## Getting started

#### Pre-requisites
The following software is necessary to build and run Chimera:

   * `Oracle JDK`  or `OpenJDK` available at  [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and make sure the environment variable `JAVA_HOME ` points to your JDK folder (e.g. like [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Java-Home)).
   * Apache `Tomcat 7` or 8, available at [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi).
   * `MySQL 5.7` Server, available [here](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
   * `git`, available  [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), to access the code repositories.
   * Apache Maven 3, available [here](http://maven.apache.org/install.html).

#### Installation & Setup

   1. Checkout out the source code from [github](http://github.com/bptlab/chimera). From the command line you can run `git clone https://github.com/bptlab/chimera.git` to download the repository to your machine.
   1. Copy the project configuration `/src/main/resources/config.properties` from the template `config_template.properties` and fill in your properties.
   1. Start your `MySQL server` and create a database, either using the `MySQL Workbench` or from the command line: `mysql -u USER_NAME -p PASSWORD -e "create schema SCHEMA_NAME` where `SCHEMA_NAME` should be something like ChimeraDB.
   1. Build the source code using Maven: `mvn install -Ddb.user=USER_NAME -Ddb.password=PASSWORD -Ddb.schema=SCHEMA_NAME` Replace *USER_NAME*, *PASSWORD*, and *SCHEMA_NAME* with the values from the previous step.
   1. Deploy the created war file `target/Chimera.war` to Tomcat by copying it to the webapps folder in your Tomcat installation.
      * Alternatively, use `mvn tomcat7:deploy-DskipTests` from the command line to automatically deploy the war file. Note however, that you need to configure your Tomcat credentials as described in [this article](http://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-deploy-maven-based-war-file-to-tomcat/).
   1. Start your Tomcat application server and visit http://localhost:8080/Chimera in your browser, replacing the default port 8080 with the one you configured in Tomcat. You should now be able to see the Chimera frontend.

## Modeling Case Models

For this you need the [Gryphon Case Modeler](https://github.com/bptlab/gryphon) which allows to create case models and deploy them into the Chimera engine.

## REST API

See the [pdf documentation](https://github.com/bptlab/chimera/raw/dev/docu/rest/JEngine_REST_Specs.pdf) inside the docu folder or refer to the [swagger files](https://github.com/bptlab/chimera/raw/dev/docu/rest/swagger.json).
